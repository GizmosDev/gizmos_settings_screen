name: gizmos_settings_screen
description: >-
  A Flutter package for displaying settings screens (or similar screens). I
  built this after finding it near impossible to customize the look and feel of
  the other popular settings screen packages. This package takes a different
  approach and separates the functionality from the UI customization. This lets
  you create custom skins to better fit into your existing app. There are
  several skin prototypes included for Cupertino (light and dark modes), and
  Material (light and dark modes). In most cases, you can just subclass those,
  alter your colours and move on to the rest of your app.

  This package doesn't depend on any specific package for settings storage. In
  fact, `gizmos_settings_screen` can be used for any type of general purpose
  cell based list, it's just that settings is the most obvious use case. The
  example application included uses `shared_preferences`, but I've also used
  `flutter_secure_storage` in production apps.

flutter:
  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
